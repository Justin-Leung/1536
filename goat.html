      <p>People born in a year of the Goat are generally believed to be gentle
      mild-mannered, shy, stable, sympathetic, amicable, and brimming with a
      strong sense of kindheartedness and justice.They have very delicate thoughts,
      strong creativity, and perseverance, and acquire professional skills well.
      Although they look gentle on the surface, they are tough on the inside,
      always insisting on their own opinions in their minds. They have strong
      inner resilience and excellent defensive instincts.</p>
